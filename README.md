Enabled Hello Robot’s Stretch 2 Robot to retrieve an Inbrija Inhaler for Parkinson’s Disease patients during OFF episodes.

Using ROS 1, we successfully developed a 7 stage retrieval functionality using pre-existing point cloud models, PID control, and 3D transformations to manipulate the robot’s base, arm, camera, and gripper.
